# Aspiring to become a software developer? Allow me to dodge that bullet for you.
- ***Topics that will be covered***
- 1. Corruption drips from the top down.
  2. It's one cult, and you're not in it...but it's smaller than you imagine.
- 3. Websites are not your friend. Your competitor already set up shop long ago.
- 4. What makes a site happy. Something you will not have when first entering this realm. /paradox
- 5. You are being actively targeted, harassed, and sabatoged. You just haven't found out yet.
- 6. Hacked ***yet***? Following the trail of breadcrumbs. This isn't your pappy's Hansel & Gretel.
- 7. Noteworthy earmarks of decadent crony capitalism: Ministry of Truth, devfluencers, the reward system, public contributions, and you. Our ancestors have left us nothing but for thugs, tyrants and astrofurf. 


***When you see signs, protect your friends, family, and reputation. Do not be afraid of judgement. Do not be silent.***

I'll be taking my time. It might save a life.
