# Aspiring to become a software developer? Allow me to dodge that bullet for you.
- ***Topics that will be covered***
- 1. Corruption drips from the top down.
  2. It's one cult, and you're not in it...but it's smaller than you imagine.
- 3. Websites are not your friend. Your competitor already set up shop long ago.
- 4. What makes a site happy. Something you will not have when first entering this realm. /paradox
- 5. You are being actively targeted, harassed, and sabatoged. You just haven't found out yet.
- 6. Hacked ***yet***? Following the trail of breadcrumbs. This isn't your pappy's Hansel & Gretel.
  7. Déjà vu? Before the internet, that shop on the other side of town was the reason yours got burned to the ground. Nowadays you'll be followed from one block to the next with molotovs and street theatre.
- 8. Wait a second. I've seen newcomers achieve great success in very little time. > More than likely they aren't "new", but the same people again and again. Plus nepotism. This happens in every industry, but even more so where there's anonymity.
- 9. Noteworthy earmarks of decadent crony capitalism: Ministry of Truth, devfluencers, the reward system, public contributions, and you. Our ancestors have left us nothing but for thugs, tyrants and astrofurf.

***When you see signs, protect your friends, family, and reputation. Do not be afraid of judgement. Do not be silent.***

I'll be taking my time. It might save a life.
